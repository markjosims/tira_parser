# tira_parser
Dataset and FST code for Tira morphological parsing

## Dependencies
### Linux
Should just need `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### MacOS
Pynini requires [OpenFST 1.8.3](https://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstDownload). Earlier versions might work as well. If using 1.8.3 note the patch described in [this github issue](https://github.com/gpustack/gpustack/issues/1798#issuecomment-2980869111).

Once OpenFST is installed, `pip install -r requirements.txt` should work.
